# logogen

## How it is constructed
    There are around 5 prompts that will pop up when activating the app on terminal. Each function for the prompts are categorized by names that are titled on js files listed in the library folder. Logogen will then create a logo in reference to your answers. An .svg file should be added into your VS at the end of the process.
